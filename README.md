A QR code (Quick Response code) is a two-dimensional barcode that can store information in a machine-readable format. It consists of black squares arranged on a white background, and it can be scanned by a QR code reader or a smartphone camera.

QR codes are widely used for various purposes, including:

Website URLs: QR codes can store website addresses, allowing users to quickly access a website by scanning the code instead of typing the URL manually.

Product Information: QR codes can contain details about a product, such as its name, description, and pricing. Scanning the code can provide users with instant access to this information.

Business Cards: QR codes on business cards can store contact information, making it easier for others to save your contact details to their phone with a single scan.

Authentication: QR codes can be used for two-factor authentication, where users scan a code displayed on a screen to verify their identity.

Ticketing and Payments: QR codes are commonly used for event ticketing and mobile payments. Scanning the code allows users to access their tickets or make payments quickly and conveniently.

A QR code generator is a tool that allows you to create QR codes. It takes the data or information you want to encode and generates the corresponding QR code image. QR code generator provide options to customize the appearance of the QR code, such as the size, color, and error correction level.
